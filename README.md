# ASCII-ART

This was originally a study project realized with [LeRacoune](https://github.com/LeRacoune) and [nathuc69](https://github.com/nathuc69)

We decided to publish it as a Go package to test the conversion process and make it available for others.

We're planning to add several features to our little project, including : 
- colors
- multiple styles/fonts
- many other cool stuff...
